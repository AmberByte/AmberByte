# Hey there! 👋

I’m a Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience, and I’m truly passionate about creating projects that inspire and excite. I love exploring new technologies and getting hands-on with whatever sparks my curiosity. 🤓

## 🧑‍💻 Here’s a peek at what I’m currently working with:
- Go
- TypeScript
- Vue.js
- Generative AI (including Large Language Models and Image Generation)

## Hackero

My current project is hackero.io, a hacking simulation game with real-time gameplay. It features a desktop-style interface, a functional filesystem, and missions to complete. I launched a classic version a while back, but I’m currently rewriting it to expand the game’s depth and features.

The backend is a custom-built framework based on Domain-Driven Design, supporting real-time connections. It’s been a rewarding project to work on, and I’m excited to share the next version.
