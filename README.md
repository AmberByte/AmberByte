## **Hackero**
My current project is [**Hackero**](https://hackero.io) — a **real-time hacking simulation game** with a desktop-style interface.  

### Key Features:
- **Functional Filesystem**: Dive into a system that feels alive.  
- **Challenging Missions**: Hone your hacking skills with dynamic challenges.  
- **Domain-Driven Backend**: A custom-built framework designed for seamless real-time gameplay.  

A classic version is already live, but the **next generation** is in the works with deeper gameplay and even more exciting features. I can’t wait to share it with the world! 🌍
